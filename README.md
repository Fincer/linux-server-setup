Basics of a single Linux server/client environment
==============

- This repository is related to single-server/client Linux (server) environments.

- This repository, as for now, doesn't contain any advanced set-up & maintenance instructions for multi-client/server environment techniques such as Puppet or Salt.

- This repository doesn't contain instructions to set up containers, such as Docker or Systemd-nspawn.

- The repository is mainly set up as a requirement by a school cource in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki, Finland.

- The repository contains various exercises, originally presented in Finnish but translated into English due to practical purposes.

- All bourne shell files (sh) presented in this repository are not directly related to the exercises but they are useful in some situations.

- **NOTE!** Instructions in this repository may not directly apply to your setting. The instructions have not been tested in a production environment, so if you decided to use them in your system configuration, you should apply them with care. I do not take any responsibility in a case of failure or broken system configurations.
