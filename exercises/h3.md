Linux servers - Exercice 3
==============

*Disclaimer:*
--------------

This exercise is a part of [Linux servers (ICT4TN021, spring 2018) // Linux-palvelimet (ICT4TN021, kevät 2018)](http://www.haaga-helia.fi/fi/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/ICT4TN021) school course organized as a part of Information Technology studies in Haaga-Helia university of Applied Sciences, Helsinki, Finland. Course lecturer [Tero Karvinen](http://terokarvinen.com/) has defined the original assignment descriptions in Finnish presented in this document in English. Answers and translations have been written by Pekka Helenius (me, ~ Fincer).

**a)** Install Apache web server and set up a working web environment for each system user (http://example.com/~tero). Test the correct functionality with a sample website.

**Answer:**

```
#!/bin/sh

# List package names of Uncomplicated Firewall ja Apache HTTP web server in a new variable PROGRAMS

# Define new function 'install'

# Function 'install' - BEGIN
function install() {

    ############
    # Look for executable 'apt-get', silent error printing (stderr), print count of matching strings.
    # Define these checks in a new variable APT_CHECK so that these checks can easily be performed later in the script.
    #
    # grep part could have been excluded but it is still good to check that this file is not compromised and is truly
    # an executable binary file.
    #
    # EXAMPLE If the system is compromised and the attacker replaces file /usr/bin/apt-get with his/her own version, the following
    # APT_CHECK might successfully pass without additional grep pipe (check additional notes below).
    #
    # Demonstration is as follows (in root shell, because we assume that the attacker has access to root account).
    # It is pretty clear that if the attacker has root access, almost all hope is lost because the attacker can likely access and modify almost any part in the system. However, we don't speculate with this option here.
    #
    # root@my-machine:/home/phelenius# echo -e "#\!/bin/sh\necho \"Attacker's code\"\n" > /usr/bin/malicious
    # root@my-machine:/home/phelenius# chmod +x /usr/bin/malicious
    # root@my-machine:/home/phelenius# which malicious
    # /usr/bin/malicious
    #
    # The file /usr/bin/malicious is identified as executable. However, if we check its mimetype, we can find out the following:
    # root@my-machine:/home/phelenius# file --mime-type $(which malicious)
    # /usr/bin/malicious: text/plain
    #
    # Therefore we can find out the executable we though would be a binary is simply a text file. In similar way, the following APT_CHECK command would pass without grep pipe which fills the security gap a little bit. However, there's still a hole. A major risk still exist because attacker could have replaced the valid apt-get executable with his/her own malicious binary file (with correct mimetype application/x-sharedlib). In this scenario, a checksum validation should seriously be considered (compare against a trusted apt-get binary file).

```

**b)** Browse and explore the websites on your local host. Find out any hints of successful (200 ok) website load events and failed load events (for example, 404 not found). Analyse the relevant lines.
--------------

**Answer:**

**NOTE!** My detailed answer to this assignment is in the previous exercise 2, section a) (successful & failed event + analysing them). Link: [Exercise 2]()

In my answer I have analysed Apache web server log lines. The logic is exactly same than required in this assignment. Apache logs each event when a client (web browser, for example) try to access a file or location in server.

**c)** Create a purposeful error in any code line which is executed by Apache web server (PHP or Python, for example). Find out any relevant log lines and analyse them in detail.

**Answer:**

Let's install PHP 7.0 with Apache2, and execute a shell script which does as required.

- size of the object is 185 (reported to the client program)

- [User agent header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) reported by the client. According to the agent string, client browser has been gecko-based [Epiphany web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(GNOME)), using x86_64 processor architecture. This string can be manipulated in the client end. For example, a desktop client web browser can pretend to be a mobile browser.

**e)** Install and try out PhpMyAdmin or similar out-of-the-box web-based database management solution.
--------------

**Answer:**

**NOTE!** We assume that the established Linux system has a working Apache HTTP daemon web server and PHP 5.0 or PHP 7.0 script language packages installed as Apache modules (see tasks a) and c) above).

1. [phpMyAdmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpMyAdmin) requires MySQL/MariaDB database back-end server. Let's install MySQL database server with its runtime dependencies on Debian-based distribution (Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS in this case).

```
sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server
```

2. Local administrator (assumed to belong to sudo group) is asked to set a new password for root MySQL database root account:

**NOTE!** This description applies to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Newer OS releases may not ask you to set MySQL password after MySQL server installation. If you don't see a blue screen stating "While not mandatory...", run the following command instead:

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

```
Configuring mysql-server-5.7

While not mandatory, it is highly recommended that you set a password for the MySQL administrative "root" user.                                                          

If this field is left blank, the password will not be changed.                       

New password for the MySQL "root" user:
```

We should choose a strong password ('Hu8aS1n?tI23' or 'Tu$pAR!iMu65' etc. Can be generated with a password generator program _pwgen_ as well). We should use a password which we don't use in other environments.

**NOTE!** If unsure, check and configure your keyboard layout so that the password you supply will be correctly set up.

When you have entered your password, press _TAB_ and then press _<Ok>_ (or just _ENTER_). Type the password again and continue.

3. Let's install [phpMyAdmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpMyAdmin) with its runtime dependencies on Debian-based distribution (Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS in this case).
 
```
sudo apt-get install -y phpmyadmin
```

Accept the installation with extra dependencies. 

4. On Debian-based systems, the next screen states:

```
Configuring phpmyadmin

Please choose the web server that should be automatically configured to run phpMyAdmin.

Web server to reconfigure automatically:

[] apache2
[] lighttpd
```

Because we assume that you have Apache2 and not lighttpd, we should select apache2. Press _SPACE_ so that option _apache2_ has asterix in the brackets ([*]). After that, press _TAB_ to move the selection to _<Ok>_ and press _ENTER_.

5. The next screen states:

```
Configuring phpmyadmin

The phpmyadmin package must have a database installed and configured before it can be used. This can be optionally handled with dbconfig-common.

If you are an advanced database administrator and know that you want to perform this configuration manually, or if your database has already been installed and configured, you should refuse this option. Details on what needs to be done should most likely be provided in /usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin.                                                                        │ 

Otherwise, you should probably choose this option.

Configure database for phpmyadmin with dbconfig-common?
```

The most common selection in this step is _<Yes>_ (alternative to _<No>_). For choosing a right choice, the following manuals can be used:
[Configure the database with dbconfig-common](https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/fr/install-guide-debconf/debconf/debconf-dbconfig-common.html)
[dbconfig-common.pdf](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/dbconfig-common/dbconfig-common.pdf)
[Stackoverflow - What means dbconfig-common](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31403273/what-means-dbconfig-common)

Additionally, for example:
![dbconfig-common_1](https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/fr/install-guide-debconf/_images/dbconfig-common_keep_admin_pass.png)
![dbconfig-common_1](https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/fr/install-guide-debconf/_images/dbconfig-common_used_for_remote_db.png)

Let's choose option _<Yes>_ because we don't have earlier database in our system. More secure, although more troublesome, approach would be selecting _<No>_, according to the material references above.

**NOTE!** dpkg tool _dpkg-reconfigure_ makes it possible to change package-related configuration in Debian-based systems afterwards (for example, _sudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin_). However, pay special attention and use extra care if you do any configurations  afterwards.

6. The next screen asks system administrator to set up MySQL database-related password for phpmyadmin MySQL user:

```
Configuring phpmyadmin

Please provide a password for phpmyadmin to register with the database server. If left blank, a random password will be generated.

MySQL application password for phpmyadmin:

Let's pick up a strong password for phpmyadmin. Take a look on step 2. for setting up a strong password. Use different password here.

7. If you are not asked to set up a default phpmyadmin username or password, please run _sudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin_. The default phpmyadmin username is usually 'phpmyadmin' and the login password is the one you write down by executing the command mentioned earlier in this step.

8. Let's try accessing phpMyAdmin front page:

```
xdg-open http://localhost/phpmyadmin
```

If the installation has been successful, the web browser view should look like this:

![phpmyadmin-loginpage](https://rootninja.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/image38.png)

9. Log in to phpMyAdmin with the following credentials:
- **user name:** phpmyadmin (or any other defined during phpmyadmin installation)
- **password:** password defined in step 7.

10. If successfully logged in, the web browser view should be as follows (phpMyAdmin - Front page):

**f)** Create a web application which executes a simple calculation for the user (BMI calculator, for example)
--------------

**Answer:**

**NOTE!** We assume that the Linux installation has a working Apache HTTP daemon web server with correct PHP support enabled. Apache server has 'userdir' module enabled, and some local user has _public_html_ folder created.

1. Let's create the following, very simple PHP code and save it to ~/public_html/rainfall.php (current user)

```
<?php
	$rainfalls = array(54.2, 43.1, 37.5, 25.6, 10.2, 15.7, 29.4, 41.9, 55.6, 69.1, 77.2, 64.3);

	// Print output
	echo "Total rainfall is " . array_sum($rainfalls) . " millimeters in a year.";
?>

```

2. Let's open the php file with the default graphical web browser found in the local Linux system:

```
xdg-open http://example.com/~$(whoami)/rainfall.php
```

Result:
